> ESLint plugin for indentation

## Usage

Don't use it yet. :)

## Why

The core `indent` rule in ESLint checks for a specific number of spaces and is not configurable to allow this number to vary. While it's a good idea to standardize how many spaces are used for indentation, you might not need or want to enforce that level of consistency.

This plugin allows for validating that no tabs or no spaces are used for indentation, regardless of the number.

## Under Development

This plugin is under active development and its API may change at any time.
